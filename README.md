# Pands Project - Fisher Iris dataset #

## Introduction ##

The Iris flower data set is a well known data set used to demonstrate various statistical models or algorithims. This data set is the core focus of presenting my learning in the Programming and Scripting module of the Higher Diploma in Data Anslytics from the ATU - the ATlantic Technologcal UNiversity

I will begin this project with a brief history of the Fisher Iris data set.

Sir Ronald Aylmer Fischer was born in London England in 1890. He was a statisician and a geneticist. In 1912 he graduated from Cambridge University with a degree in astronomy. He founded the  Cambridge Society eugenics Society. HE held many prestigious positions in his career. In 1933 he was a Galton Professor of Eugenics in UNiversity College London. In 1943 He was appointed the BAlfour Professor of Genetics at Cambrige. He was a forerunner in the application of statistical procedures to scientific experiments. Fisher developed formula for his "exact test", the "maximum likelihood estimator" and the "analysis of variance".
His work included the following three papers: Statistical Methods for research (1925), The Genetical Theory of NAtural Selection (1930) and Statistical Methods and Scientific Inference (1956)

In 1936 he published a paper titled "The Use of Multiple Measurements in Taxanomic Problems" in the journal "Annals of Eugenics". In this paper he described a linear function to differentiate between three species of the Iris flower genus.

The data he used in the paper was collected by botanist Edgar Anderson in the Gaspe Peninsula of Canada. Edgar Anderson graduated from Michigan State College in 1918 with a degree in botony and agriculture. In 1920 he was awarded a masters and in 1922 he was awarded a doctorate of science in agricultural genetics.

The data Me Anderson collected quantifies the morphologic variations of 3 species of Iris flowers : the Iris Versicolor, Iris Setosa and the Iris Virginica.

The data set has 50 samples of each of the three species. So 150 samples total. The four features of the flowers that were measured were the petal length, the petal width, the spepal length and the spepal width.

## Uses of the Iris Fisher dataset ##

The Iris dataset is widely used in pattern recognition learning. One varient of the Iris flower is linearly separable from the other 2 varients. Those two varients are not linerly separable from each other.

Thw data set is used in data exploration, machine learning and data visualisaetion. it is well understood dataset that can be used to demonstarte many concerpts of data science. Many resources can be fouond online and is thus ideal for beginners of data science.

Data Exploration - The analysis of the data set can be used to identify patterns and relationships in the data.
Machine Learning - Algorithims can be developed to classify the different Iris species based on charcteristics in the data set.
Data Visualisation - The data set can be visualised using histograms, scatter graphs and box plots.
