### Pands Project - Fisher Iris dataset ###

## Introduction ##

The Iris flower data set is a well known data set used to demonstrate various statistical models or algorithims. This data set is the core focus of presenting my learning in the Programming and Scripting module of the Higher Diploma in Data Anslytics from the ATU - the ATlantic Technologcal UNiversity

I will begin this project with a brief history of the Fisher Iris data set.

Sir Ronald Aylmer Fischer was born in London England in 1890. He was a statisicain and a geneticist. Fisher developed formula for his "exact test", the "maximum likelihood estimator" and the "analysis of variance".

In 1936 he published a paper titled "The Use of Multiple Measurements in Taxanomic Problems" in the journal "Annals of Eugenics". In this paper he described a linear function to differentiate between three species of the Iris flower genus.

The data he used in the paper was collected by botanist Edgar Anderson in the Gaspe Peninsula of Canada. The collected data quantifies the morphologic variations of 3 species of Iris flowers : the Iris Versicolor, Iris Setosa and the Iris Virginica.

The data set has 50 samples of each of the three species. The four features of the flowers that were measured were the petal length, the petal width, the spepal length and the spepal width
